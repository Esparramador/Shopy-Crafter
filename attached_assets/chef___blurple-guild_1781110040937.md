# Blurple Guild

## Overview
Blurple Guild is a dark-mode community design system inspired by the platform where gamers, creators, and communities gather in servers and voice channels. It blends a distinctive blue-purple ("blurple") accent with deeply dark backgrounds, rounded shapes, and a friendly personality that makes real-time communication feel like hanging out with friends. The aesthetic is approachable yet dense, balancing playful visual touches with the functional demands of managing dozens of active conversations simultaneously.

Plus Jakarta Sans is used at weights 400, 500, 600, and 700 throughout the interface. Server names and channel categories use 700 weight at 12px uppercase with 0.02em letter-spacing for a compact, label-like appearance. Channel names use 500 weight at 16px. Message body text uses 400 weight at 16px with 1.375 line height for comfortable reading in long conversation threads. Usernames in message headers use 500 weight in role-assigned colors. JetBrains Mono renders code blocks with a distinctive #2B2D31 background and 1px #3F4147 border. The type scale: 12px (category labels/timestamps), 14px (small text/meta), 16px (body/channels), 20px (section titles), 24px (server headers/modals), 28px (settings page titles).

## Elevation
The dark interface uses layered backgrounds for depth. The server list sidebar sits at #1E1F22 (darkest), the channel sidebar at #2B2D31, the main message area at #313338, and the member list at #2B2D31. Popovers and context menus use #111214 background with 4px border radius and 0 8px 16px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.24) shadow. Modals use #313338 background with 0 0 0 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08), 0 16px 32px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.24) shadow and a rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7) backdrop overlay. User profile popouts float with 0 8px 16px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2) shadow. The philosophy is color-layer-first with shadows reserved for floating elements.

Server icons are 48px squares with 16px radius (morphing to circle on hover via CSS transition). Active server has a 40px white pill indicator on the left edge.

## Do's and Don'ts
- Do use blurple (#5865F2) as the signature interaction color — it's the brand heartbeat
- Do use role colors for usernames — the colorful message feed is a signature visual element
- Do support "cozy" and "compact" message display modes with different spacing
- Do use the three-column layout pattern — server list, channel sidebar, main content + optional member list
- Do round server icons from 16px to full circle on hover — this micro-interaction is iconic
- Don't use light backgrounds in the main interface — the entire experience is dark mode
- Don't override role colors with arbitrary styling — role hierarchy and color assignment are community identity
- Don't space messages too far apart — conversation flow requires density, especially in active channels
- Don't use borders on text inputs — the background color difference (#1E1F22 on #313338) provides sufficient contrast
